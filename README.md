- [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) - This helped me for adding event listener. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- Learn Instance methods [add()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/add) and [remove()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/remove)
- [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout ) - This is an amazing article which helped me how to work with setTimeout function. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
